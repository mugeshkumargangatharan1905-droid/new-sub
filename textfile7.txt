Title: Poor People in India and the Impact of Black Money

Introduction:
India is a developing country with a large population. Even though the country has achieved progress in technology, education, and infrastructure, poverty is still a serious problem. Many people struggle to afford basic needs like food, shelter, education, and healthcare.

What is Black Money?
Black money refers to income that is not reported to the government and on which taxes are not paid. It is usually earned through illegal activities or hidden business transactions. Because it is not declared, the government cannot use it for public welfare.

Impact on Poor People:
When black money exists in large amounts, the government loses tax revenue. This means there is less money available for schools, hospitals, roads, and employment schemes. Poor people depend more on these public services, so they are affected the most.

Economic Inequality:
Black money increases the gap between the rich and the poor. Wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of a few people, while many others continue to live in poverty. This creates social and economic imbalance in the country.

Government Measures:
The government has taken steps like demonetization, stricter tax laws, and promoting digital payments to reduce black money. These actions aim to make the economy more transparent and fair.

Conclusion:
Reducing black money can help improve public welfare and reduce poverty. A transparent financial system supports development and helps create equal opportunities for everyone, especially poor and middle-class citizens.
