Title: Struggles of Poor Students to Go Abroad for Higher Studies

Introduction:
Many students in India dream of going abroad for higher studies. They want better education, international exposure, and good career opportunities. However, for poor students, this dream is often very difficult to achieve.

Financial Problems:
Studying abroad is very expensive. Students must pay tuition fees, accommodation charges, travel expenses, and living costs. Poor families cannot easily afford these expenses. Even applying for universities and exams like IELTS, TOEFL, or GRE requires money.

Lack of Guidance:
Poor students may not have proper guidance about foreign universities, scholarships, and admission procedures. Without support, they may miss important opportunities.

Education Loans and Risks:
Some students take education loans to study abroad. But repaying the loan can be stressful. If they do not get a good job after graduation, it becomes a financial burden for the family.

Scholarships and Support:
Scholarships and government schemes help many deserving students. Hard work, good academic performance, and proper research can increase the chances of getting financial aid.

Conclusion:
Although poor students face many struggles in going abroad for higher studies, determination, scholarships, and proper guidance can help them achieve their dreams. Education should be an opportunity for everyone, not only for the rich.
